# 🔍 Recommender Systems with Apriori & FP-Growth

This repository contains the implementation of **Recommender Systems** using the **Apriori** and **FP-Growth** algorithms. The goal of this project is to analyze data and extract frequent patterns to provide better recommendations to users.

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 **Apriori Algorithm** for association rule mining from transactional data
- 🌲 **FP-Growth Algorithm** for efficient pattern discovery
- 📈 Data analysis and visualization to understand discovered patterns
- 🛠️ Clean and well-documented code with detailed explanations

## 📊 Usage Example
The following example demonstrates how to use the **Apriori** algorithm for analyzing a set of transactions:
```python
from src.apriori import apriori
transactions = [['Milk', 'Bread', 'Eggs'], ['Milk', 'Diaper', 'Beer', 'Eggs'], ['Milk', 'Bread', 'Diaper', 'Beer']]
rules = apriori(transactions, min_support=0.5, min_confidence=0.7)
print(rules)
```

## 📌 Dependencies
- **pandas** 📊 for data processing
- **mlxtend** ⚙️ for association rule mining
- **matplotlib & seaborn** 📈 for data visualization

## 🎯 Future Plans
- Adding more algorithms such as **Collaborative Filtering**
- Optimizing algorithm performance for large datasets
- Creating an interactive dashboard for better data analysis
